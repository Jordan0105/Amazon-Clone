# Amazon Clone

This is an Amazon clone made from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. \
This was my first fairly "big" project where I set out to recreate the interface of the Amazon website from 0 without copying the code from the original. \
The site is not responsive and may not look good on small screens.
